I am a Post Doctoral Researcher at Laboratoire Ingénierie Circulation Transports (LICIT) in Université Gustave Eiffel, Lyon.  My research is focused broadly on the numerical solution of partial differential equations with emphasis on **discontinuous Galerkin methods**, **high-order numerical schemes**, **hyperbolic conservation equations**, **traffic flow modeling**. Besides, I have been working on **data analysis** in my current position. I wrote my thesis at Departament of Civil Engineering, Architecture and Georesources (DECivil) at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon and Laboratori de Càlcul Numèric (LaCaN) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona.
