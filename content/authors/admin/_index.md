I am a Research Engineer in AVALON team at Laboratoire de l'Informatique du Parallélisme (LIP) in INRIA, Lyon working on SKA Telescope project.  My research is focused broadly on the numerical solution of partial differential equations with emphasis on **discontinuous Galerkin methods**, **high-order numerical schemes**, **hyperbolic conservation equations**, **traffic flow modeling**, **data analysis** and **high performance computing**. I wrote my thesis at Departament of Civil Engineering, Architecture and Georesources (DECivil) at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon and Laboratori de Càlcul Numèric (LaCaN) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona.
