abstract: A coupling strategy between hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) and continuous Galerkin (CG) methods is proposed in the framework of second-order elliptic operators. The coupled formulation is implemented and its convergence properties are established numerically by using manufactured solutions. The influence of parameter, $\tau$, on the coupled formulation is studied.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
