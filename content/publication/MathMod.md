abstract: Filament winding is one of the most used automated techniques for manufacturing of composite objects with different open-end or closed-end structures. Mathematical model for covering an elbow mandrel with composite material is considered. The nature of the comprising equations is elaborated in detail. A practically orientated algorithm for filament winding for elbows is formulated and its open-source implementations in Python and MATLAB are presented. The results from the constructed algorithm are presented and discussed.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The paper presents a simple algorithm for the filament winding for elbows.
