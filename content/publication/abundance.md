abstract = "Sparsity-based unmixing algorithms, exploiting the sparseness property of the abundances, have recently been proposed with promising performances. However, these algorithms are developed for the linear mixture model (LMM), which cannot effectively handle the nonlinear effects. In this paper, we extend the current sparse regression methods for the LMM to bilinear mixture models (BMMs), where the BMMs introduce additional bilinear terms in the LMM in order to model second-order photon scattering effects. To solve the abundance estimation problem for the BMMs, we propose to perform a sparsity-based abundance estimation by using two dictionaries: a linear dictionary containing all the pure endmembers and a bilinear dictionary consisting of all the possible second-order endmember interaction components. Then, the abundance values can be estimated from the sparse codes associated with the linear dictionary. Moreover, to exploit the spatial data structure where the adjacent pixels are usually homogeneous and are often mixtures of the same materials, we first employ the joint-sparsity (row-sparsity) model to enforce structured sparsity on the abundance coefficients. However, the joint-sparsity model is often a strict assumption, which might cause some aliasing artifacts for the pixels that lie on the boundaries of different materials. To deal with this problem, the low-rank-representation model, which seeks the lowest rank representation of the data, is further introduced to better capture the spatial data structure. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms provide much enhanced performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms."
