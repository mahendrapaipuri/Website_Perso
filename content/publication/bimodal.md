abstract = "Pixelwise classification, where each pixel is assigned to a predefined class, is one of the most important 
procedures in hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. By representing a test pixel as a linear combination of a small subset of 
labeled pixels, a sparse representation classifier (SRC) gives rather plausible results compared with that of traditional 
classifiers such as the support vector machine. Recently, by incorporating additional structured sparsity priors, the 
second-generation SRCs have appeared in the literature and are reported to further improve the performance of HSI. These 
priors are based on exploiting the spatial dependences between the neighboring pixels, the inherent structure of the 
dictionary, or both. In this letter, we review and compare several structured priors for sparse-representation-based 
HSI classification. We also propose a new structured prior called the low-rank (LR) group prior, which can be considered 
as a modification of the LR prior. Furthermore, we will investigate how different structured priors improve the result 
for the HSI classification."
